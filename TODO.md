# Ideas
## Create chat function
- Allow between employee and manager and HR
- Websockets

## Feedback portal
- For end of probation period

## Register interest for project
- So employees can read on a project and if it sounds interesting, assign their interest for a manager to look into the opportunities

# Essential to do:
## Create relevant tables
- Objecitves
- Projects

## Add middleware to check Auth and permissions
- Can either middleware it or just add it into the controllers

## Create controller and services for projects and objectives
- Add, edit
    - Check that only HR can add edit some of them...
    

## Create front end pages for viewing objectives and projects

## Create Manager and HR views on front end for objectives and projects

## Allow edit of objectives

## Allow add new employees
- HR only

## Assignment to projects
- Manager and HR

## Add not found page
